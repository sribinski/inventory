# ðŸ§® Inventory Management System (Python CLI)

A simple command-line inventory management program built as part of my self-learning path in Python.  
It focuses on clean logic, type hints, modular functions, and user input validation.

## ðŸ§  What I Practiced
- Core Python: lists, dictionaries, loops, functions
- Built-ins: `sum`, `max`, `sorted`
- Type hints (`typing.List`, `typing.Dict`, union types)
- Error handling and user input validation
- Small, single-responsibility functions
- Working with modular and readable code
